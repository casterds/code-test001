# Carbon Credit Market Place & Dashboard

A simple dashboard to display all available carbon credit on the Toucan platform. Querying th Toucan graph data and interacting with the Toucan SDK.

# Project Description
CarbonXchange is a decentralized application (DApp) that aims to revolutionize the carbon credit market by providing a platform for buying and selling carbon credits in a transparent and efficient manner. The DApp consists of two main components: a carbon storefront and a climate impact dashboard.

## Carbon Storefront:
The carbon storefront allows users to browse and purchase carbon credits from various pools available on the platform. These pools represent verified and certified carbon offset projects from around the world. Users can explore different carbon credit options, view project details, and choose the credits that align with their sustainability goals. The storefront provides a seamless and secure payment process using cryptocurrency, enabling easy and borderless transactions.

## Climate Impact Dashboard:
The climate impact dashboard provides users with a comprehensive overview of their carbon footprint and environmental impact. Users can connect their accounts and explore their retirement portfolios to assess the carbon emissions associated with their investments. The dashboard visualizes the carbon emissions data and provides insights into the environmental consequences of their financial decisions. Users can track their progress in reducing their carbon footprint and explore options to offset their emissions.

Additionally, the dashboard allows users to redeem their TCO2 tokens, earned through various activities or purchased from the carbon storefront, for carbon credits from the available pools. Users can retire their TCO2 tokens and contribute to verified carbon offset projects, actively participating in environmental conservation efforts.

Overall, CarbonXchange empowers individuals and organizations to take action against climate change by providing a user-friendly platform for buying carbon credits, understanding their climate impact, and actively supporting sustainable projects. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, transparency, and decentralized governance, CarbonXchange aims to drive global efforts towards carbon neutrality and a more sustainable future.
